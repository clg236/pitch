A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/bloqhead/pen/KQgeVB.

 Based on [this post](https://codepen.io/Godje/post/bouncing-particles-tutorial) by [Godje](https://codepen.io/Godje/). The only thing I added was a function for random color changes based on an array of RGB values.
